# 13th-Challenge-ORM-E-Commerce--Backend

## What was my objective and what have i achieved?
In this project i was tasked with creating a fully functional backend for an E-Commerce page, i believe that i have successfully been able to do this by ensuring that when the user does a get request via postman/insomnia they are then presented with with a list of the categories, products and tags.

In addition i was also tasked with ensuring that the user will be able to sucessfully update, delete and create new items for each of the previous mentioned section which i have also been able to accomplish by allowing the user to add, remove and update any section that they want.
